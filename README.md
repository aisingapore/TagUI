Write flows (scripts) in simple TagUI language and automate your web, mouse and keyboard interactions on the desktop.

TagUI is free to use and open-source. It's easy to setup and use and works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

In TagUI language, you use _steps_ like `click` and `type` and interact with _identifiers_:

```
