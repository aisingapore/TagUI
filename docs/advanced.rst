Advanced concepts
===================

.. _object-repository:

Object repositories
------------------------
Object repositories are optional :ref:`csv files <what-are-csv-files>` which can store variables for use in flows.

Each flow has a **local object repository** and all flows share the **global object repository**. The local object repository is the ``tagui_local.csv`` in the same folder as the flow. The global object repository is the ``tagui_global.csv`` in the ``tagui/src/`` folder.

An object repository could look like this:

============== =================================
object         definition
-------------- ---------------------------------
email          user-email-textbox
create account btn btn--green btn-xl signup-btn
============== =================================

Within the flow, TagUI can use the objects ``email``, ``create account`` as variables and they will be replaced directly by the definitions before it is run. Local definitions take precedence over global definitions.

If ``user-email-textbox`` was the identifier for some web text input, then you could use the following in your flow::

  type ``email`` as my_email@email.com

.. _datatables:

Datatables
------------
Datatables are :ref:`csv files <what-are-csv-files>` which can be used to run your flows multiple times with different inputs.

A datatable (``trade_data.csv``) could look like this:

= ============ ============= ======== ====== ====== =========
# trade        username      password pair   size   direction
- ------------ ------------- -------- ------ ------ ---------
1 Trade USDSGD test_account  12345678 USDSGD 10000  BUY
2 Trade USDSGD test_account  12345678 USDJPY 1000   SELL
3 Trade EURUSD test_account  12345678 EURUSD 100000 BUY
= ============ ============= ======== ====== ====== =========

To use it, you run your flow with ``tagui my_flow.tag trade_data.csv``. TagUI will run ``my_flow.tag`` once for each row in the datatable (except the header). Within the flow, TagUI can use the variables ``trade``, ``username``, ``password``, etc as if they were in the :ref:`local object repository <object-repository>` and the values will be from that run's row.

You can run the flow with the ``speed`` option like this: ``tagui my_flow.tag trade_data.csv speed`` to remove the delay between runs.

Running other flows within a flow
-----------------------------------
A flow can run another flow, like this::

  tagui login_crm.tag

Variables in the parent flow are accessible in the child flow. 

Visual automation tricks
------------------------------------
If you remove the background of a UI element in a ``.png`` file using an image editor, TagUI will be able to target the element regardless of its background. 

Conversely, you can also remove the foreground content near some anchor element like a frame, to allow you to OCR varying content in the empty area using the **read** step.

Writing Python within flows
--------------------------------
You can write Python code in TagUI flows. Python needs to be `installed separately <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. 

The ``py`` step can be used to run commands in Python (TagUI will call ``python`` on the command line). You can pass string values back to TagUI with `print()`. The ``stdout`` will be stored in the ``py_result`` variable in TagUI.

.. code-block:: none

  py a=1
  py b=2
  py c=a+b
  py print(c)
  echo py_result

You can also use ``py begin`` and ``py finish`` before and after a Python code block::

  py begin
  a=1
  b=2
  c=a+b
  print(c)
  py finish
  echo py_result

You can pass a variable to Python like this::

  phone = 1234567
  py 'phone = ' + phone
  py print(phone)
  echo py_result

Saving flow run results
-------------------------
You can save an html log of the run and the flow run results to ``tagui/src/tagui_report.csv`` with the ``report`` option. ::

    tagui my_flow.tag report

The CSV file will show one line for each run, when it started, how long it took to complete, any error message during run, and the link to the log file for that run.

Create log files for debugging
---------------------------------
To do advanced debugging, you can create log files when running flows by creating an empty ``tagui_logging`` file in ``tagui/src/``.

- ``my_flow.tag.log`` stores output of the execution. 
- ``my_flow.tag.js`` is the generated JavaScript file that was run.
- ``my_flow.tag.raw`` is the expanded flow after parsing modules.
