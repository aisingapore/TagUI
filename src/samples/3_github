// automation flow files start with an URL to tell TagUI where to go

// this flow goes to a GitHub page and downloads the repo using 2 ways
// for issues or questions, kindly feedback on GitHub or support@tebel.org
// see cheatsheet for steps, conditions, finding element identifiers, etc
// https://github.com/tebelorg/TagUI#cheat-sheet

// use read (or fetch) step to fetch webpage element text to variable
fetch (//*[@class="numbers-summary"]/li)[5] to license_type

// use check step to check a condition and print result to output
// text to put in quotation marks to differentiate from variables
check license_type equals to "MIT" | "Yes, repo is under MIT license." | "No, repo is not under MIT license."  

// note - some websites including GitHub may detect and block automated downloads
// use download step to proactively download a file directly from an URL
download https://github.com/tebelorg/TA.Mail/archive/master.zip to download.zip

// use receive step for event-based download when an URL accessed contains your keyword
receive archive/master.zip to receive.zip

// as it is event-based, you will need to interact with the webpage to trigger download
click Clone or download
click Download ZIP

// use api step to call api and print response (bonus example for developers and tinkerers)
// variables can be used (eg from fetch or read step, files or self-declared)
// use '+variable_name+' to incorporate variables into your api call 
var country = "SG";
api http://services.groupkt.com/country/get/iso2code/'+country+'
