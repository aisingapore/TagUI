// automation flow files start with an URL to tell TA.Gui where to go

// this set of flows uses datatables to reach out to GitHub Starrers
// flows 6A - get URLs of Starrers, 6B - get contact info, 6C - email Starrers
// for issues or questions, kindly feedback on GitHub or support@tebel.org
// see cheatsheet for steps, conditions, finding element identifiers, etc

// CONTEXT - When TA.Gui beta was released, someone shared to Hacker News
// and GitHub stars for this project jumped from 2 to 1.5k in about 1 week.
// I wanted to send an one-time thank you email to all TA.Gui supporters,
// so I created these automation flows to let my laptop do the job quickly.
// Otherwise it requires copying out 1500 URLs, loading 1500 profile pages,
// and using some 3rd-party newsletter service to send out the emails.

// datatables extend the power of repositories files to manage batch automation
// datatable has 2 or more columns, for example below (headers up to you to name)
// data-centric approach with rows representing data fields (usually row = test case)
// TA.Gui loops through each column to automate using values from different datasets
// for example, echo "PAGE NUMBER - `page_no`" in your flow shows PAGE NUMBER - 1

// contents of 6A_datatables.csv
// 6A_GETURL,#1,#2,#3
// page_no,1,2,3

// now here's the actual flow, it grabs URLs of first 3 pages of Telegram Starrers 

// use JavaScript to define an array, TA.Gui supports JavaScript directly in the flow
var ID = []; // JavaScript can be used as needed to create more complex automation flows

// for loop in natural language
for n from 1 to 76

{ // opening brace to denote whole section belonging to loop

// below grabs the URL, does some filtering of results, and outputs the URL to screen and log file
ID[n]="https://github.com"+this.getElementAttribute(x('(//*[contains(@class,"follow-list-item")]//a)['+2*n+']'),"href");
if ID[n] not contains "/login?return_to="
echo ID[n]

// you can also use JavaScript to do post-processing and append to a file, or to a format directly usable by flow 6B
// if ID[n] not contains "/login?return_to="
// {var fs = require('fs'); fs.write("/tmp/urls.csv", ID[n] + "\n", 'a');}

} // closing brace to denote end of the section belonging to loop
