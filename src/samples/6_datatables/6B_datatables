`user_url`
// automation flow files start with an URL to tell TA.Gui where to go

// this set of flows uses datatables to reach out to GitHub Starrers
// flows 6A - get URLs of Starrers, 6B - get contact info, 6C - email Starrers
// for issues or questions, kindly feedback on GitHub or support@tebel.org
// see cheatsheet for steps, conditions, finding element identifiers, etc
// https://github.com/tebelorg/TA.Gui#cheat-sheet

// CONTEXT - When TA.Gui beta was released, someone shared to Hacker News
// and GitHub stars for this project jumped from 2 to 1.5k in about 1 week.
// I wanted to send an one-time thank you email to all TA.Gui supporters,
// so I created these automation flows to let my laptop do the job quickly.
// Otherwise it requires copying out 1500 URLs, loading 1500 profile pages,
// and using some 3rd-party newsletter service to send out the emails.

// datatables extend the power of repositories files to manage batch automation
// datatable has 2 or more columns, for example below (headers up to you to name)
// data-centric approach with rows representing data fields (usually row = test case)
// TA.Gui loops through each column to automate using values from different datasets
// for example, echo "URL - `user_url`" in your flow shows URL - https://github.com/s0b0lev

// contents of 6B_datatables.csv // with 3 random Telegram GitHub userids as learning examples
// file in this format can be from flow 6A using JavaScript, or using Excel transpose function
// 6B_GETCONTACT,#1,#2,#3
// user_url,https://github.com/s0b0lev,https://github.com/zongUMR,https://github.com/jkmartindale

// now here's the actual flow, it goes to their profile URLs and grabs their contact information

// JavaScript can be used as needed to create more complex automation flows

// define blank variables so errors won't be thrown for profiles with missing info
fullname = ""; username = ""; email = ""; url = ""; country = ""; bio = "";

// read User Full Name and GitHub ID to variables
read fullname to fullname
read username to username

// read User Email to variable if information exists
if check_tx('//*[@itemprop="email"]')
read //*[@itemprop="email"] to email

// read User Website to variable if information exists
if check_tx('//*[@itemprop="url"]')
read //*[@itemprop="url"] to url

// read User Location to variable if information exists
if check_tx('//*[@itemprop="homeLocation"]')
read //*[@itemprop="homeLocation"] to country

// read User Biography to variable if information exists
if check_tx('user-profile-bio')
read user-profile-bio to bio

// show the information retrieved to screen and log file
echo fullname "," username "," email "," url "," country "," bio

// write the information received into a csv spreadsheet file
var fs = require('fs'); fs.write("/tmp/contacts.csv", "\""+fullname+"\",\""+username+"\",\""+email+"\",\""+url+"\",\""+country+"\",\""+bio+"\"\n", 'a');
